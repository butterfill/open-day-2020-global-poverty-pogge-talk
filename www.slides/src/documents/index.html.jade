    As we speak, there are probably over 600m people who live on under $1.90 a day
    at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates using 2011 prices.
    This means no healthcare, no education, poor or no housing, and inadequate nutrition.

    p.em-above Libertarians
    //- .slide

    //-     ‘Libertarianism is a family of views in political philosophy.
    .slide
      p.em-above: :t
        ‘strongly value individual freedom and see this as justifying
        strong protections for individual freedom.’
    .slide
      p.em-above: :t
        ‘usually see the kind of large-scale, coercive wealth
        redistribution in which contemporary welfare states engage as involving
        unjustified coercion.’
      .notes: :t
        So you can see Libertarians are relevant because they 
        would probably not accept that there is a duty to help,
        but would probably accept a duty not to harm.

    So who is responsible?
  .notes: :t
    Two thoughts.
  .notes: :t
    Pogge establishes that,
    purely from the perspective that we have a duty not to cause avoidable and forseable harm,
    you and I, as residents of wealthy countries, 
    are responsible to some degree.
  .notes: :t
    But his critic Patten shows that unless you are a libertarian,
    there is a further duty which arises from the needs of those who
    live in extreme poverty.

      A ‘\emph{mandatory right} confers no discretion whatever on its possessor:
      only one way of exercising it is permitted. It leaves one path open to him but
      no genuine "option" between paths. It imposes a correlative duty on others to
      provide that path and leave it unobstructed [...]. If I
      have a mandatory right to do X then it follows logically that I have [...] a duty to do X. 
      In the case of mandatory rights, duty and right are entirely coincident’
