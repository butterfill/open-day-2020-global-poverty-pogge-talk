TITLE: Who is responsible for global poverty?

DESCRIPTION: The philosopher Thomas Pogge asks, do ‘the global poor have a much stronger moral claim to that 1 percent of the global product they need to meet their basic needs than we affluent have to take 81 rather than 80 percent for ourselves’?  This talk will introduce the argument Pogge provides for a positive answer to this question. This argument is striking because it is depends, or is supposed to depend, only on premises which even a libertarian (who would be opposed to redistribution in principle) would accept.  But it has also been heavily criticised. We will therefore consider one of the best lines of objection to Pogge's argument. Whether or not Pogge is right, there is much to be said for the widely-rejected view that individual citizens of wealthy countries---so most of the audience for this session---are responsible for the harms of global poverty.
